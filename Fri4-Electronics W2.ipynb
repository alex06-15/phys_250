This is because voltage is correlated to resistance which decreases with light intensity for a photoresistor so a maximum in luminance at the focal point would provide a minimum in the graph of voltage. We can then conclude that the focal point is a minimum in voltage. Because the resistance of the photoresistor has a maximum and there is ambiant light, we expect to observe a leveling off in voltage for large values, converging to some voltage at infinity. The y intercept should be at some positive value larger than the minimum. This is because the inntensity isnt at a minimum because of the intensity of the light but not at a maximum because of there is light is more concentrated than at a further point."
